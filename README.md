## Data Visualizations
### Lehigh University Enrollment
I created the following visualizations based on Lehigh's Undergraduate enrollment. 
<iframe title="Chart: 2017 Lehigh University Undergraduate Enrollment" aria-describedby="This pie chart shows the percentages of undergraduate enrollment in the six colleges at Lehigh University in2017. College of Arts &amp; Sciences had the largest enrollment among all." id="datawrapper-chart-8QcK0" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8QcK0/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="621"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px")}})}();</script>


<iframe title="Chart: 2017 Lehigh University Undergraduate Enrollment" aria-describedby="This bar chart represents Lehigh's 2017 undergraduate enrollment by home residence.  Minorities include Asian, Black, Hispanic, Multi-Racial, American Indian or Native Alaskan,	Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander - U.S. Citizens only." id="datawrapper-chart-oTMpS" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oTMpS/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="273"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px")}})}();</script>


<iframe title="Chart: College Enrollment at Lehigh University 2008-2017" aria-describedby="Percentage of students enrolled within the three colleges at Lehigh University over the past 10 years." id="datawrapper-chart-uIEYr" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uIEYr/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px")}})}();</script>
It is interesting to note the rapid decline in students enrolled within the College of Engineering in 2016 as well as the College of Business & Economics. This could be due to the increase in students enrolled within interdisiplinary programs, which increased from 4.3% in 2015 to 11.4% in 2016.

### News Consumption Project
<iframe title="Chart: Political news dominates as the most-read category online" aria-describedby="This chart shows the most frequently read news topics online and the distribution of readers by age group in the U.S. " id="datawrapper-chart-ns9iN" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ns9iN/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="424"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px")}})}();</script>

The above chart is my first visualization when exploring patterns between our generation's news consumption behavior to the rest of the population.

## Google 360 Tour
For college students today, we are constantly fed news throughout or day whether we want to be or not. From phone alerts, to Facebook ads, to snapchat stories and in-class discussions, we receive an overwhelming amount of news. In our final project, we plan to evaluate college students consumption habits compared to other adults. In this tour, we look to see some of the ways and places in which Lehigh University promotes "keeping up with current events," promotes dialogue on important topics and caters to students behavioral patterns.
